            <p class="fnt-twenty">In October of 2018 Rev. Charles (CJ) Harkness began serving as Pastor of People's Community Church in Berea,
                Ohio. He accepted this call after over 20 years of service as an associate minister at Mt. Zion Church of
                Oakwood Village under the leadership of Pastor Larry L. Macon, Sr. and Co-Pastor's Larry Macon, Jr. and Daniel
                Macon. Having accepted Christ at an early age and his call to ministry as a college student, Pastor Harkness
                has served in many aspects of church operation including preaching, Christian education, singing, ushering
                and security. He is humbled and excited about the call to lead a church as Pastor.
            </p>

                including Director of Institutional Diversity, Director of Multicultural Student Services and Director of
                Student Conduct. These roles allowed him to gain a wealth of experience in meeting the needs of ethnic minority
                and at risk students. Currently, he is charged with oversight of the University's diversity initiatives as
                set forth in the University's Strategic Plan. CJ also promotes dialog and gauges the pulse of the campus
                community as they relate to issues of diversity and inclusion through his leadership of BW's Center for Inclusion.

                and presenter for a number of organizations and programs. CJ has also taught courses and presented in high
                schools, colleges and several Ohio prisons.</p>
